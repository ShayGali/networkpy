# Networkpy Course

Welcome to the **networkpy** Python Course!

This repository contains my progress and project for the course on network programming using Python's socket library. In this course, I learned how to build TCP and UDP servers and clients, and I applied these concepts to create a terminal-based trivia game.

## Project

The course wae project oriented, you can find the project in the [Project](project) folder. The project is a terminal-based trivia game that uses network programming concepts to fetch trivia questions from an external API. The game also uses file I/O to save and retrieve game data, simulating a database.

## Course Package

The course package can be found at [Course Package Link](course_summary). This package includes all the necessary materials, lessons, and instructions to learn about network programming with Python.

## What You Will Learn

Throughout this course, I gained the following skills and knowledge:

- **Understanding of Sockets**: Learned the fundamentals of sockets for network communication.
- **TCP and UDP**: Built both TCP and UDP servers and clients.
- **Project Development**: Developed a terminal-based trivia game using network programming concepts.
- **File Handling**: Incorporated file I/O to save and retrieve game data, simulating a database.
- **API Integration**: Utilized external APIs to fetch trivia questions, enhancing the game's content.
- **Version Control**: Managed project progress and versioning using Git.
